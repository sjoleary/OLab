      <description>The geographic structure of marine fish populations is an important element used in defining stock units, and genetic data have historically been used for this purpose. Here, genetic data were used to elicit population genomic patterns for Atlantic Croakers Micropogonias undulatus collected at five locations in the Gulf of Mexico (hereafter, “Gulf”) and a single location in the southern U.S. Atlantic. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA ) haplotypes were used as a baseline for historical lineage delineation and in a comparison with a previous Atlantic Croaker study that was centered on the Atlantic coast.</description>
