[{"categories":null,"contents":"Traditional methods for evaluating the importance of elasmobranch nursery habitats have focused on estimating densities or abundances of juveniles within individual nurseries; however, rates of juvenile mortality may vary among nurseries. Thus, abundance may not reflect contribution to adult populations, and contribution estimates require methods to identify the nursery origin of adults. We evaluated the use of natural tags, vertebral chemistry (stable isotope analysis, elemental analysis) and genetic markers, to identify bull shark Carcharhinus leucas nursery origin along the Texas coast (northwestern Gulf of Mexico) at multiple spatial scales. Sharks were most accurately assigned (89% accuracy) to their regional origin (Northern vs. Southern Texas) using a combination of vertebral chemistry and genetic markers. Accuracy decreased when incorporating only one type of natural tag (vertebral chemistry: 58%–84%; genetics: 30%–58%), or when assigning sharks among nurseries grouped into three or four regions (30%–71%; ~100 km spatial scale). Synthesis and applications . We describe a novel method integrating multiple natural tags to identify the nursery origin of a highly migratory coastal elasmobranch, over smaller spatial scales than previously investigated. This framework provides a powerful tool to estimate the relative source (nursery) contributions to adult populations of highly mobile species, which represent production estimates sought in the designation of essential fish habitat and ultimately incorporated into marine spatial planning practices.\n","permalink":"/publications/bullsharksnurseryorigin/","tags":["bullsharks","nursery origin","microchemistry","mixed stock analysis"],"title":"Natural tags identify nursery origin of a coastal elasmobranch Carcharhinus leucas"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The geographic structure of marine fish populations is an important element used in defining stock units, and genetic data have historically been used for this purpose. Here, genetic data were used to elicit population genomic patterns for Atlantic Croakers Micropogonias undulatus collected at five locations in the Gulf of Mexico (hereafter, “Gulf”) and a single location in the southern U.S. Atlantic. Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA ) haplotypes were used as a baseline for historical lineage delineation and in a comparison with a previous Atlantic Croaker study that was centered on the Atlantic coast. A genomic data set consisting of 3,682 single‐nucleotide polymorphism (SNP )‐containing loci was used to assess contemporary gene flow throughout the sampled area. Both the mtDNA and SNP data sets showed significant between‐basin estimates of genetic divergence (ɸst = 0.049 and F ST = 0.002, respectively), while pairwise F ST implied a low magnitude of divergence (F ST ≤ 0.002) at all geographic scales. Comparison of patterns obtained from putatively “neutral” versus “outlier” SNP loci suggested contrasting genetic patterns at the extremes of the sampling distribution in the Gulf. Putatively neutral SNP s implied a single stock in the Gulf, whereas a handful of outliers suggested distinct populations in the eastern and western Gulf. The pattern observed at outlier loci could imply either the presence of natural selection impacting a small number of loci or otherwise could be explained as a remnant pattern reflective of historical geographic isolation. In either case, the weak population structure observed at a small number of SNP loci may be indicative of a more significant demographic structure; for this reason, caution is urged when treating Atlantic Croakers as a single stock in the Gulf.\n","permalink":"/publications/croaker/","tags":["pop structure","atlantic croaker"],"title":"Population Structure of Atlantic Croakers from the Gulf of Mexico: Evaluating a Single‐Stock Hypothesis Using a Genomic Approach"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Southern flounder, Paralichthys lethostigma, historically support a substantial fishery along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the southern United States. Low year-class strengths over the past few years in the western Gulf of Mexico have raised concern that spawning stocks may be overfished. Current management of the resource includes releasing hatchery-raised juveniles to restock bays and estuaries; additionally, there is a growing interest in the potential for commercial aquaculture of the species. Currently, genomic resources for southern flounder do not exist. Here, we used two hatchery-reared families and double-digest, restriction-site-associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to create a reduced-representation genomic library consisting of several thousand single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) located throughout the genome. The relative position of each SNP-containing locus was determined to create a high-density genetic map spanning the 24 linkage groups of the southern flounder genome. The consensus map was used to identify regions of shared synteny between southern flounder and seven other fish species for which genome assemblies are available. Finally, syntenic blocks were used to localize genes identified from transcripts in European flounder as potentially being involved in ecotoxicological and osmoregulatory responses, as well as QTLs associated with growth and disease resistance in Japanese flounder, on the southern flounder linkage map. The information provided by the linkage map will enrich restoration efforts by providing a foundation for interpreting spatial genetic variation within the species, ultimately furthering an understanding of the adaptive potential and resilience of southern flounder to future changes in local environmental conditions. Further, the map will facilitate the use of genetic markers to enhance restoration and commercial aquaculture.\n","permalink":"/publications/sthflounderlinkmap/","tags":["linkage map","southern flounder"],"title":"Genetic mapping and comparative genomics to inform restoration enhancement and culture of southern flounder, Paralichthys lethostigma"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Sequencing reduced‐representation libraries of restriction site‐associated DNA (RAD seq) to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP s) is quickly becoming a standard methodology for molecular ecologists. Because of the scale of RAD seq data sets, putative loci cannot be assessed individually, making the process of filtering noise and correctly identifying biologically meaningful signal more difficult. Artefacts introduced during library preparation and/or bioinformatic processing of SNP data can create patterns that are incorrectly interpreted as indicative of population structure or natural selection. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully consider types of errors that may be introduced during laboratory work and data processing, and how to minimize, detect and remove these errors. Here, we discuss issues inherent to RAD seq methodologies that can result in artefacts during library preparation and locus reconstruction resulting in erroneous SNP calls and, ultimately, genotyping error. Further, we describe steps that can be implemented to create a rigorously filtered data set consisting of markers accurately representing independent loci and compare the effect of different combinations of filters on four RAD data sets. At last, we stress the importance of publishing raw sequence data along with final filtered data sets in addition to detailed documentation of filtering steps and quality control measures.\n","permalink":"/publications/snpfiltering/","tags":["RAD data sets","bioinformatics","SNP filtering"],"title":"These aren’t the loci you’re looking for: Principles of effective SNP filtering for molecular ecologists"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Gene flow between populations is restricted in fragmented habitats, which can promote a more rapid genetic diversification as evolutionary forces act on isolated gene pools. Here, we compare two silverside species occurring in a continuous coastal habitat (tidewater silverside, Menidia peninsulae Goode and Bean, 1879) vs a highly fragmented habitat consisting of hypersaline pools (key silverside, Menidia conchorum Hildebrand and Ginsburg, 1927). First, we aim to better resolve the morphological and genetic relationships between the two nominal species using a haplotype analysis at two loci (NADH dehydrogenase 2, internal transcribed space r2) and geometric morphometrics. Despite some haplotype sharing and incomplete lineage sorting, they were both genetically differentiated (φST = 0.2186 and 0.4198, respectively, P \u0026lt; 0.0001) and showed significant discriminating morphometric characteristics. Second, we made a temporal comparison of genetic diversity and effective population size (Ne) in key silversides over time using seven polymorphic microsatellite loci and found that genetic diversity and Ne of key silversides were lower in these pools compared to tidewater silversides in the marine environment and decreased over time. We conclude that key silversides more likely represent an ecotype of the tidewater silverside and thus harbor a distinct adaptive potential. Further, our results support the hypothesis that highly fragmented aquatic habitats promote rapid genetic change and species diversification. Finally, we discuss the management applications of our study pertaining to the current listing of key silversides as a National Marine Fisheries Service Species of Concern.\n","permalink":"/publications/menconchorum/","tags":["microsats","Menidia","effective populations size","genetic diversity"],"title":"Population genetics and geometric morphometrics of the key silverside, Menidia conchorum, a marine fish in a highly-fragmented, inland habitat"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The white shark, Carcharodon carcharias, is both one of the largest apex predators in the world and among the most heavily protected marine fish. Population genetic diversity is in part shaped by recent demographic history and can thus provide information complementary to more traditional population assessments, which are difficult to obtain for white sharks and have at times been controversial. Here, we use the mitochondrial control region and 14 nuclear-encoded microsatellite loci to assess white shark genetic diversity in 2 regions: the Northwest Atlantic (NWA, N = 35) and southern Africa (SA, N = 131). We find that these 2 regions harbor genetically distinct white shark populations (ΦST = 0.10, P \u0026lt; 0.00001; microsatellite FST = 0.1057, P \u0026lt; 0.021). M-ratios were low and indicative of a genetic bottleneck in the NWA (M-ratio = 0.71, P \u0026lt; 0.004) but not SA (M-ratio = 0.85, P = 0.39). This is consistent with other evidence showing a steep population decline occurring in the mid to late 20th century in the NWA, whereas the SA population appears to have been relatively stable. Estimates of effective population size ranged from 22.6 to 66.3 (NWA) and 188 to 1998.3 (SA) and evidence of inbreeding was found (primarily in NWA). Overall, our findings indicate that white population dynamics within NWA and SA are determined more by intrinsic reproduction than immigration and there is genetic evidence of a population decline in the NWA, further justifying the strong domestic protective measures that have been taken for this species in this region. Our study also highlights how assessment of genetic diversity can complement other sources of information to better understand the status of threatened marine fish populations.\n","permalink":"/publications/greatwhitesgendiv/","tags":["microsats","white sharks","effective populations size","genetic diversity"],"title":"Genetic Diversity of White Sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, in the Northwest Atlantic and Southern Africa"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Juvenile Atlantic sturgeon (Acipenser oxyrhinchus oxyrhinchus) forming aggregations at coastal sites in the mid-Atlantic Bight were subjected to a mixed stock analysis (MSA) and individual-based assignment using twelve microsatellite loci.

Of the 460 individuals sampled 322, 36 and 47 were assigned to the Hudson, James and Delaware Rivers, respectively. MSA estimated that the New York Bight Distinct Population Segment (Hudson River and Delaware River) contributed 83–90 % of individuals to the marine aggregations and the Chesapeake (James River) and Southeast Distinct Population Segments contributed 5.5–11 %. Mean M-ratios were lower than expected at equilibrium in all three rivers (Delaware = 0.726, Hudson = 0.748, James = 0.664), indicative of genetic bottlenecks affecting all three spawning populations. Further, there were low but detectable levels of inbreeding in all three rivers populations. Effective population size (Ne) was estimated for three populations: Hudson River (172–230 individuals), James River (40–100 individuals) and Delaware River (75–186 individuals). Despite these issues, simulations based on life-history information and the Ne estimates suggest that if ongoing management measures are effective, contemporary levels of population genetic diversity are likely to be retained over the next century.\n","permalink":"/publications/stugeonne/","tags":["microsats","sturgeon","effective populations size"],"title":"Genetic diversity and effective size of Atlantic sturgeon, Acipenser oxyrhinchus oxyrhinchus river spawning populations estimated from the microsatellite genotypes of marine-captured juveniles"},{"categories":null,"contents":"The white shark, Carcharodon carcharias, and sand tiger shark, Carcharias taurus, are large-bodied lamniform sharks, which are apex predators throughout the temperate zone worldwide.

Inbreeding is therefore not typically a focal concern of marine fish management.

The effective number of breeders for 1–2 years was remarkably small, with point estimates ranging from 65–289 individuals. Excess homozygosity was detected at 10 loci in all bays (FIS = 0.169–0.283) and individuals exhibited high average internal relatedness (IR; mean = 0.226). These both indicate that inbreeding is very common in all bays, after testing for and ruling out alternative explanations such as technical and sampling artifacts.

Lake Constance has a naturally pulsing hydrograph with average amplitudes of 1.4 m between winter drought and summer flood seasons (annual flood pulse (AFP)). Additionally, heavy rainstorms in summer have the potential to create short-term summer flood pulses (SFP). The flood pulse concept for lakes predicts that littoral organisms should be adapted to the regularly occurring AFP, ie taking advantage of benefits such as an influx of food sources and low predator pressure, though these organisms will not possess adaptations for the SFP. To test this hypothesis, we studied the aquatic invertebrate assemblages colonizing the gravel sediments of Lake Constance, the AFP in spring and a dramatic SFP event consisting of a one meter rise of water level in 24 h. Here, we introduce the term ‘hypolacustric interstitial’for lakes analog to the hyporheic zone of running water ecosystems. Our results confirm the hypothesis of contrasting effects of a regular AFP and a random SFP indicating that the AFP enhances the productivity and biodiversity of the littoral zone with benthic invertebrates displaying an array of adaptations enabling them to survive. The littoral zones of lakes deliver important ecosystem services by regulating flood effects, producing biomass and supporting biodiversity. To maintain and foster these services, the maintenance or reintroduction of natural water level fluctuations and the conservation of the habitat structures of the hypolacustric interstitial are urgently needed.\n","permalink":"/publications/benthinvert/","tags":["benthic invertebrates","species diversity","limnology"],"title":"Flood pulse effects on benthic invertebrate assemblages in the hypolacustric interstitial zone of Lake Constance"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Although a previous genetic mixed‐stock analysis (gMSA) conducted in the early 1990s showed that marine‐captured New York Bight Atlantic sturgeon Acipenser oxyrinchus oxyrinchus almost exclusively originated from the Hudson River, fish from southern U.S. rivers were well represented within this contemporary sample (n = 364 fish), at least during the autumn.
