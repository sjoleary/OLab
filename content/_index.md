Our **RESEARCH** focuses on the molecular ecology and conservation genomics of primarily marine fishes. We achieve this using genomic data sets to identify patterns of connectivity and population structure, explore the interaction with and adaptation to the environment on a genetic level, and determine how this applies to conservation and management. 

## Teaching

#### **Current Courses**:

* Conservation Biology (BI328)


We learn and do science together following three principles:

#### 1. Learn to ask the right questions, not just to have all the right answers.

#### 2. The best way to learn to do something new is to ‘watch one, do one, teach one’.

#### 3. Nobody is expected to not make any mistakes, everybody is expected to learn from them.

(*also, nobody has time to make all the mistakes themselves, learn from other people's mistakes*)

## Research

Research projects fall into two major categories:

#### Using **molecular markers** to understand **microevolutionary processes** & **ecological patterns**
* Connectivity & local adaptation in marine fishes
* Population-level effects of an oil spil on the genetic diversity of demersal fishes
* Genetic diversity of small populations

  
#### Using **molecular markers** to characterize & identify **individuals**, **populations**, and **species**

* **DNA Fingerprinting** to identify individuals and their relationships to each other with a variety of applications, including aquaculture.
* **Mixed stock analysis** to determine the contribution of individual rivers and estuaries that form the natal habitat and/or nurseries of juveniles recruiting to populations offshore.
* **Genetic barcoding** for species identification - even when the whole specimen is not available for morphological assessment.
