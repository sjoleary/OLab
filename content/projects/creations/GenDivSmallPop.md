title: Genetic diversity of small populations
---

### Current Projects

* Conservation Genetics of Bullsharks in the northwest Gulf of Mexico
* Genetic diversity & biocomplexity of chinook salmon

### Past Projects

* comparison of effective population sizes of white sharks in the Northwest Atlantic and Southern Africa
* Population genetics and geometric morphometrics of a marine fish in a highly-fragmented, inland habitat.
* Genetic diversity of effective population size of Atlantic sturgeon river spawning populations.
* Small effective number of breeders in a formerly abundant marine fish.
